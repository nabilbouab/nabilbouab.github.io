_This blog post is included in a series where we are going to build a framework in JavaScript that will help us create our own resume engine. Find the first article of the series here._

In the previous post, we saw how to render the data from our model when it is a simple value. It is very nice in order to work with our name, city etc, for very simple attributes. How about experiences and projects? We have several different ones but they all have the same format. We are going to understand how to display collections of objects.

In order to display the collection of items, I need to have an example of how to display one element, and then I do the same for the others. I need a blueprint, that I will use to print each element of the collection after putting the data at the right place inside this example. In order to be able to grab this blueprint element from the HTML into my JavaScript code, I will have to set a naming convention. This naming convention is the following: if the collection is named “projects”, the blueprint of the item in this collection will be named “projects_item”. For example, I want to display an array of projects, I will give the blueprint the id “projects_item” and then work with it in my JavaScript code. Let’s see how it looks like in the code:

```javascript
var model = {
	"name": "nabil bouabdallah",
	"firstname": "nabil",

function isObject(value) {
  var type = typeof value;
  return value != null && (type == 'object' || type == 'function');
}

function populateElement(new_html_elem, model_element){
	for(var key in model_element){
		var html_element_to_populate = new_html_elem.getElementsByClassName(key)[0];
		if(html_element_to_populate){
			html_element_to_populate.innerHTML = model_element[key];
		}
	}
}

var fields = document.querySelectorAll('*[id]');

for(var index = 0; index < fields.length; index++){
	var field_name = fields[index].id;
	if(field_name.indexOf("_item") > -1){
		var model_elem = field_name.split("_")[0];
		var new_html_elem = fields[index];
		for(var i = 0; i < model[model_elem].length; i++){

			populateElement(new_html_elem, model[model_elem][i]);

			fields[index].parentNode.appendChild(new_html_elem);
			new_html_elem = fields[index].cloneNode(true);
		}
	}
	else{
		fields[index].innerHTML = model[field_name];
	}
}
```
Line 1 to 5 is just the raw data that compose my resume, we can find collections such as projects, experiences, education and languages. It all begins when I create the variable `fields` and populates it with all the DOM elements that have ids in my HTML document. I iterate over all these fields and for each one, I look at the id and store it in `field_name`. Does the id, have “\_item” inside it? If it doesn’t, then get the value in the model object that has the name equal to the id. If it does have “\_item” — and this is much more interesting — it means that we are faced to the blueprint of an item of the collection. Now we want to retrieve the part of the id before “\_” in order to be able to look it up in our model. For example, if we have an id which is equal to “project\_item” we grab “project” which is an array of objects in the model. Then, we iterate over the array in the model and for each element we populate it. In order to make it clearer, I created a function on it’s own (it is not very useful in this case, it is just for clarity sake). We give to this function the HTML blueprint element as `new_html_elem` and the corresponding array in the model. Then, this function will go and look for the elements by class name and put the right data at the right place. Once we populate the element, we append it to the parent item of the one which has “\_item” in his id. Then, we clone the node, in order to create a new one etc. :D.

This is it for today. In the next part, we will talk about how to internationalize our personal website with a button to change the language of the resume.
